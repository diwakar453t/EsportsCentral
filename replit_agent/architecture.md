# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture. It outlines the key components, technologies, data flow, and design decisions that form the foundation of the application.

[This section should summarize the purpose of the application, its key functionality, and the overall architectural approach]

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
[Describe the high-level architecture pattern used (e.g., MVC, microservices, serverless) and provide a diagram or textual representation of how the main components interact]

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: [List frontend frameworks/libraries]
- **Backend**: [List backend frameworks/technologies]
- **Database**: [Describe database technology, potentially Drizzle ORM]
- **Authentication**: [Describe authentication mechanism]
- **Infrastructure**: [Describe hosting/deployment infrastructure]

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
[Describe the main frontend components, their responsibilities, and how they interact]

### Backend Components
[Describe the main backend components, such as services, controllers, and middleware]

### Data Model
[Describe the high-level data model and important entities]

## Data Flow

### Request Lifecycle
[Describe how a typical request flows through the system, from user interaction to response]

### Key Processes
[Outline the most important business processes and how they are implemented architecturally]

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services
[List external services integrated with the application and their purposes]

### Libraries and Frameworks
[List key libraries and frameworks used, with brief descriptions of their roles]

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
[Describe the different environments (dev, staging, production)]

### Deployment Process
[Outline how the application is deployed and updated]

### Scaling Considerations
[Describe how the application scales and any considerations for handling increased load]

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
[Detail how users are authenticated and authorized within the system]

### Data Protection
[Describe measures for protecting sensitive data]

## Future Considerations
[Outline planned architectural changes or improvements]
